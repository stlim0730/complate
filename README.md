# Complate
## Component + Template
### Template-Based Approach to Rapid Web Prototyping for Novice Users

Complate is a set of HTML code snippets with which you can start building a website. This library presents the elements you may copy & paste to your own source code.

Some elements have detailed documentation on their behavior and how you make them work (under development). Please read the documentation carefully.

Complate is deeply inpired by a great project [Bootswatch](https://bootswatch.com/) that helps beginners design web pages. It gives you source code for HTML elements and ready-to-use stylesheet based on [Bootstrap 3](https://getbootstrap.com/), which are bolts and nuts in web page design.

Complate extends Bootswatch by providing source code for components with higher complexity, built with combinations of those elements Bootswatch provides. So, Complate is *complately* compatible with Bootswatch and Bootstrap. Complate recommends using grid system of Bootstrap 3 in sizing and positioning your HTML elements.

Complate mainly aims to support rapid web prototyping in computer science education for youths. Complate has been actively used by [Youth Radio](https://youthradio.org/) where youths learn to build and contribute to digital publication of the media organization.
